# Web Scraping with Python

## Inspiration

The main focus of this project is to get a webpage data and a wikipedia page snippet. It helps in identifying a webpage elements. Instead of seeing a lot of code, it will pick out specific elements from the webpage.

## What it does

It picks out HTML elements of a webpage and snippets of Wikipedia page.

## How I built it

I built it using Python and a great library bs4 in which I importes BeautifulSoup and requests for performing it effectively. Also I used conditional loop for more seamless process.

## What I learned

I learnt more about web requests and little bit of basic HTML and its elements.
